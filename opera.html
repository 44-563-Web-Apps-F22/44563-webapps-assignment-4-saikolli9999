<h3> Pavilion in the Palace of Barataria</h3>
<p>SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
    Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
    occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
    are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
    etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
    degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
    distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
    reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.</p>
    <p class="direction">(The dance is interrupted by the unexpected appearance of Don
        Alhambra, who looks on with astonishment.  Marco and Giuseppe
        appear embarrassed.  The others run off, except Drummer Boy, who
        is driven off by Don Alhambra.) </p>
      
            <h6 class="don"> DON AL.</h6>  <p class="speech">Good evening.  Fancy ball?</p>
             <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>  <p class="speech">No, not exactly.  A little friendly dance.  That's</p>
        all.  Sorry you're late.
             <h6 class="don">DON AL.</h6>  <p class="speech">But I saw a groom dancing, and a footman!</p>
             <h6 class="mar">MAR.</h6>  <p class="speech">Yes.  That's the Lord High Footman.</p>
             <h6 class="don">DON AL.</h6>  <p class="speech">And, dear me, a common little drummer boy!</p>
             <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>  <p class="speech">Oh no!  That's the Lord High Drummer Boy.</p>
             <h6 class="don">DON AL.</h6>  <p class="speech">But surely, surely the servants'-hall is the place
        for these gentry? </p>
             <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>  <p class="speech">Oh dear no!  We have appropriated the servants'-hall.
        It's the Royal Apartment, and accessible only by tickets 
        obtainable at the Lord Chamberlain's office.</p>
             <h6 class="mar">MAR.</h6>  <p class="speech">We really must have some place that we can call our
        own.</p>
